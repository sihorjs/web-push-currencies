## Web API for push notifications

What we need for Push Notification:

1. Service Workers. Listens to push messages and displays it for active client
2. Notification API. Prompts permission to show notifications

Addition info:

VAPID Keys:

Voluntary Application Server Identification for Web Push is a spec that allows a backend server(your application server) to identify itself to the Push Service(browser specific service). It is a security measure that prevents anyone else from sending messages to an applicationâ€™s users.
You need to generate VAPID public and private Keys.
Keep your private key safe. Public key can be stored on frontend web app.
